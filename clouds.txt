Gadget idea:
Player has a projectile which he can throw and do one of the two:
1. explode to do color-specific AOE damage or maybe stun
2. teleport at any point to the location of the projectile, carrying on the velocity of the projectile

2 allows for creative parkour design (I'll see how I can make the gameplay smooth)

Either a swappable weapon or assigned buttons like Q and E (note: the player has to learn how to use these buttons
for smooth gameplay)


The level itself consists of clouds as platforms and maybe just floating rocks (like the map Ascent or practice range in Valorant).
